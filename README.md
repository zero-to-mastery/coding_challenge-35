# Coding Challenge 35 - Building Social Proof

Need to practice your HTML and CSS? Want to learn how to turn a Figma design file into actual code? Want to understand the designer to developer handoff process? Want to add a social proof section to your website? Matt Studdert, founder of www.frontendmentor.io walks you through this special coding challenge to help you become a better developer. So what's the challenge? Here it is:

This is a special Coding Challenge were **we have a video that will help you out if you get stuck**. First, you can find the full challenge starter files here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-proof-section-6e0qTv_bA

Once you read over that, you can watch Matt himself building this project. You can code along with him OR you can attempt to build it yourself then watch what Matt does afterwards to compare it to yourself. You can find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PY_iIeAKFw0

Enjoy!


## The Rules Are:

1. You will need to follow the instructions from the link above to create a Social Proof Section of a website. Bonus points if you are able to customize it and make it have your own "style".

2. **You have until March 30th at 11:59pm EST** to submit your project (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  *-challenge URL LINK TO YOUR ENTRY"* . The bot will listen for the command and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded.

4. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team.
